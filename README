Air Quality Hospital Surge Predictor - MAATANK ATHARV RISHI


This project explores whether daily air quality and weather data can be used to predict short-term surges in hospital visits for respiratory and cardiac conditions. The goal is to turn routine environmental data into a simple next-day surge risk signal that could support hospital staffing and medicine planning.


What this project does

Combines hospital visit counts with air quality and weather data

Engineers lagged, rolling, and seasonal features

Fits multiple count models (Negative Binomial and Zero-Inflated NB)

Converts predicted visit counts into surge risk categories (low / medium / high)

Outputs tables, figures, and a summary report


Data inputs

hospital_visits.csv – daily aggregated visit counts

air_quality.csv – daily PM2.5, ozone, NO2 (optionally by site)

weather.csv – daily temperature, humidity, and rainfall
